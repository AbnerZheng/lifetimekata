# LifetimeKata

Welcome to LifetimeKata, a set of exercises which you can use to improve your
understanding of lifetimes in Rust. While many tasks involve writing compiling
code, some will also involve creating specific errors.

You should complete the kata in order, as they increase in
difficulty, and depend on previous kata.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository:

``` sh
$ git clone https://www.github.com/tfpk/lifetimekata/
```

Most exercises are run in two steps:

``` sh
$ cargo build --bin ex04
```

And then either:

``` sh
$ cargo test --bin ex04
```

or:

``` sh
$ cargo run --bin ex04
```
